### General

NoxicDB is derived from LoE (Land of Elves) which was derived from WhyDB.

LoE ArcEmu World is a blizzlike world database for the ArcEmu WoW
server emulator.
It's based on WhyDB (thanks to them for their work) but with new
updates.

If you set up an NoxicCore server for your first time you need a world
database that contains all the basic information about NPCs,
gameobjects, items, spells, quests and much more.

Visit the [website](http://dev.landofelves.net) for more information.

### Preparation

Before you can install LoE DB you will need a running MySQL server.
Make a backup of your database !


### Localizations

We have added German localizations based on LoE (thanks to them
for their work) but with important updates. 
If you don't need localizations you don't need to download.


### Questions, bugs, fixes

Please ask questions or report bugs or fixes at the NoxicCore repository.
Thank you very much.
